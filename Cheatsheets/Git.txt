Cheatsheet

This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

    Commands related to a remote repository:
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git or git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository-name.git
        git push origin master
    Commands related to workflow:
        git add .
        git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
    Commands related to checking status or log history
        git status
        git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

    git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
